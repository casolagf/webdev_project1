1. The website is very easy to navigate and has a single 'shop' page, which makes finding what you want very simple. I also liked that the website was created to support an existing business, and it fits the theme of the business very well. 

2. A difference between my P1 site and Gianna's would be the user experience. Gianna said that she was unable to get the site to serve requests over HTTPS, which could deter some users. Also my site uses a little bit of JavaScript to turn the nav bar into a hamburger menu when on mobile, which makes navigation slightly easier. Other than this, our websites are very comparable. As far as maintainability, I think both of our sites are about the same. The only thing that may cause trouble in maintaining this website is how images are used, since they aren't local. If the image's host stops providing the image or moves it elsewhere, then users won't be able to see photos of the costumes they are trying to purchase because there isn't a local copy on the server.

3. The code is well structured for the most part, the only thing I may change/remove would be the "wholePage" div as it seems like the body tag or main would provide the same functionality without creating a new div.

4. There weren't any issues with the site that made it unusable. One thing I would say is that support for screen-readers could be improved, such as enclosing the navbar into a <nav> tag so that screen readers can locate it. Also the alt image descriptions were a little lacking, maybe very briefly descripe the color and/or materials used. Same goes for the design page where the two images don't have accurate descriptions.

5. Overall the website is great! It sticks with a theme and color palette and is very easy to use on both mobile and desktop, and is easy to navigate.
