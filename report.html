    <h1>This is the Report Page for Gianna Casolara's P1</h1>

    <p>
        For Project one, I created a webpage for my friends mom's costuming company. She doesn't currently have a website and she
        also gave me access an d permission to use all of the photos and information on the page. My site has 5 pages plus this Report
        page as specified by the instructions. Using theknowledge from a previous lab I was able to creat a nav bar at the top of the 
        page that follows the view of the user and I was also able to create a footer that is fixed at the bottom of the pages.
        <br> <br>

        Also, as sepcified in the directions, my site supports different layouts based on the size of the screen. My multicolumn 
        layout such as shop and deisgn can be redueced into a single column layout on a smaller screen. My site also maintains a 
        coherent style across the pages. Each page has its own css file for page specific style, but there is also a style.css 
        file for any styling that overlaps amoungst pages. My site include planty of images from the company owner that all have 
        correspoonding alt tags that describe the image. Each page has a favicon that match the over all theme of the page.
        <br> <br>
        All of my sites non-HTML sources are organized. I have a folder that holds all of the needed css files. All of my pages validate 
        without any warnings our errors using the site provided in the specs. I use several different font faces throughout my whole site. 
        My site all includes a form in the contact page, where if the user already has saved info it will automatically fill it in for them. 
        It also includes a link to another site on the shop page at the bottom and also includes an animation on the Home page
       
        My code follows all of the style requirements listed in the specs such as readability, conventional and consistant formmating, and meaningful names.
        All of my file names are entirly lower cased.
        <br><br>

        Unfortunatley,  my code only works via http and not https and I was unable to figure out why.
